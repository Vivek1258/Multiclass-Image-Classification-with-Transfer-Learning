# Multiclass-classification-104-flowers with Transfer Learning 

### Problem Statement       : Classify different types of flowers 

### Solution Proposal       : Developing and Deploying a Deep Learning CNN model to Classify the 104 types of flowers using Kaggle compitation data .

#### Solution outcome       : After proper data preprocessing and using   VGG19 model (Transfer Learning) the accuracy achieved is ::: ==  98 % 

##### Solution explaination : The Solution mainly consists of two parts : 
                     
                          1) Data Preprocessing 
                          
                          2) Selecting and Developing an appropriate model 
                          
                          3) Training and Testing of the model on the data
